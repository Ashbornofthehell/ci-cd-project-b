Usage Manual
Project Overview
This project implements a robust CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment processes for a Python-based application. It simplifies version management, ensures consistent code quality through automated testing, and accelerates deployment cycles.

Prerequisites
Python 3.9 or higher installed on your system.
Git installed for version control.
An active GitHub account to access repository and workflows.
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository
Use Git to clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copiar código
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git  
cd your-repo  
Install Dependencies
Ensure all dependencies listed in requirements.txt are installed:

bash
Copiar código
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt  
Run the Application
Launch the main Python application:

bash
Copiar código
python app/main.py  
Run Tests
Execute unit tests to validate functionality:

bash
Copiar código
python -m unittest discover tests  
Usage Guide

Main Features: Navigate the application’s UI to interact with core features.
Pipeline Execution: Push commits to the repository. The CI/CD pipeline triggers automated workflows for testing and deployment.

Maintenance Procedures
Updating Dependencies
Update the requirements.txt file to include new or upgraded dependencies:

bash
Copiar código
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade  
Adjusting CI/CD Workflows
Modify .github/workflows/ci.yml to include or refine pipeline steps. Test changes on a new branch before merging.

Debugging
Common Issues and Fixes

Dependency Installation Errors: Verify the package version in requirements.txt matches the Python version. Update as needed.
Pipeline Failures: Check logs in the Actions tab on GitHub for detailed error messages.
Testing and Logs

Run individual tests with verbose output:
bash
Copiar código
python -m unittest discover tests -v  
Add logging to monitor application behavior during execution.
Upgrade Procedures
Adding New Features

Create a feature branch and develop new functionality.
Run tests locally before pushing changes. Submit a pull request for code review and integration.
Enhancing Pipelines

Integrate additional pipeline actions or environments in .github/workflows/ci.yml.
Validate the updated pipeline on a test branch.
Repair Guidelines
Fixing Pipeline Issues

Inspect failing steps in GitHub Actions logs.
Update paths, dependency versions, or configuration settings in the ci.yml file.
Resolving Dependency Conflicts

Check for conflicts with pip check.
Update dependencies in requirements.txt or adjust the application code accordingly.
