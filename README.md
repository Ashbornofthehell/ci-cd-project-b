# CI/CD Project Documentation  

This project leverages GitHub Actions to automate testing, deployment, and continuous integration processes for a Python-based application.  

---

## **Usage Manual**  

### **Project Overview**  
The CI/CD pipeline ensures efficient version management, automated testing, and streamlined deployment of the application.  

---

### **Prerequisites**  
- Python 3.9 or higher installed.  
- Git installed on your system.  
- A GitHub account with repository access.

### **Setup Instructions**  

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Clone the project repository locally:  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
Install Dependencies:
Install required Python dependencies from requirements.txt:

bash
Copiar cÃ³digo
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application:
Execute the main application:

bash
Copiar cÃ³digo
python main.py
Run Tests:
Validate the application by running automated tests:

bash
Copiar cÃ³digo
python -m unittest discover tests
Using the CI/CD Pipeline:

Commit changes to the main branch.
GitHub Actions will automatically run the pipeline, executing tests and reporting outcomes.

Maintenance Procedures
Updating Dependencies:
Update the requirements.txt file and upgrade dependencies as needed:

bash
Copiar cÃ³digo
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
Modifying CI/CD Workflows:
Edit the .github/workflows/ci.yml file to adjust or add new steps to the pipeline. Test changes by creating a new branch and pushing the updated workflow.

Debugging
Common Issues:

Dependency Errors: Ensure compatibility between package versions in requirements.txt.
Pipeline Failures: Check the Actions tab in the GitHub repository for detailed logs.
Local Debugging:

Add print statements or logging in the application to trace issues.

Run tests with verbose output for detailed feedback:

bash
Copiar cÃ³digo
python -m unittest discover tests -v
Upgrade Procedures
Feature Updates:

Create a feature branch for implementing changes.
Test the feature locally before submitting a pull request for review and integration into the main branch.
Enhancing the Pipeline:

Update .github/workflows/ci.yml to include new steps, environments, or tools.
Test the updated pipeline in a staging branch before deploying.
Repair Guidelines
Fixing Broken Pipelines:

Review the error logs in the Actions tab of the repository.
Identify and fix issues such as incorrect paths, outdated dependencies, or syntax errors in ci.yml.
Resolving Dependency Conflicts:

Use pip check to identify conflicts between installed packages.
Update or resolve conflicting versions in requirements.txt.
bash
Copiar cÃ³digo
pip check
Conclusion
This project exemplifies the integration of CI/CD practices using GitHub Actions, providing a scalable and automated approach to development and deployment. The documentation ensures ease of use, maintainability, and debugging for future developers.
